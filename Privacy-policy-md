Egy Metro Guide takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how the app collects, uses, and protects your information.

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**
Egy Metro Guide is an independent application and is NOT owned by, affiliated with, endorsed by, or representing the Egyptian government or any governmental entity. All metro information is sourced from publicly available government resources.

**Information Collection and Use**
Egy Metro Guide does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data. The app does not use a backend server and does not require users to sign in or provide personal information.

The app may access your device's location only when it is actively in use, in order to:
- Help you find the nearest metro station
- Provide relevant station and transportation information

Location access is optional and used solely on the user's device. No location data is sent to external servers or stored in any way.

**Subscription Services**
Egy Metro Guide offers optional subscription services to provide enhanced features and an ad-free experience. Subscription payments are processed through Google Play Store's billing system. We do not collect or store payment information directly - all payment processing is handled securely by Google Play Store.

**Advertising**
Egy Metro Guide uses Google AdMob to display ads (including banner, interstitial, and open app ads). AdMob may collect limited data (such as device identifiers and usage statistics) to personalize and improve ad relevance.
